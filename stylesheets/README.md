[ASO.css](https://github.com/alphax10/alphax10/blob/main/ASO.css) (light themed version [ASO-L.css](https://github.com/alphax10/alphax10/blob/main/ASO-L.css)) are stylesheets that I prefer to use. They are optimised for high contrast and simplicity. Don't forget the stylesheets folder if you are going to use them.
