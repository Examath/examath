Hey there ðŸ‘‹
=
I've been coding since I was 10, after trying in vain to make an _app_ without any coding. I've collated a few badly made, HTML/JS (mostly math related) tools I have made over the years [here](https://examath.github.io/examath/), but nowadays I mostly develop [.net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) applications.

You can contact me, [Examath#5351](https://discordapp.com/users/813665501485989918) on discord.
